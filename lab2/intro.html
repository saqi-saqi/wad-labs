        <h2>Things I like about web development</h2>
        <p>I like web development very much in a way that it involves exploring creativity. It is kind of thrilling. We can design anything that we can imagine. It's like shaping someone's dream come true.</p>
        <h4>Websites I like</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/" >Personal Portfolio</a></li>

        <h2>Things I don't like about web development</h2>
        <p>There are some things in web development that I don't like. The increasing complexity of websites increasing with the needs/demands of websites scares me. I am really bad at making choices from a large number of domains, so choosing any style from a number of styles in CSS is a big deal for me.</p>

        <h2>Report</h2>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> In this task, I created a simple HTML webpage with different sections about myself, my likes, and dislikes about web development. I used tags like &lt;div&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, and &lt;a&gt; for structuring content. The page is styled using an external CSS file.</p>
        <p><strong>Why I chose particular tags and styles:</strong> I used &lt;div&gt; to separate sections for better organization. The &lt;h2&gt; and  &lt;h4&gt; are used for headings to make sections visually distinct. The &lt;ul&gt; tag is used for listing websites, and &lt;a&gt; is used for links to open in a new tab using the target attribute.</p>
        <p><strong>What I have learned:</strong> Through this task, I have learned how to structure a webpage properly, use different HTML tags effectively, and apply an external CSS file to improve the design.</p>
